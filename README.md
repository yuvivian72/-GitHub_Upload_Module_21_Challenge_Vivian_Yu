In this project, KaseiCoin, a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant, was created and minted using Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract mints the tokens automatically and distributes them to buyers in one transaction.
